# Gamer Language Documentation
Hello and welcome lovely humans to the documentation for the best language in the world. Gamer language has one several non-existent awards over the years and we hope to continue doing so.

Before you get started, you'll want to make sure you can actually run what you code by setting up your [compiler](https://github.com/dilanx/GamerLanguage#compiling-and-running-with-the-gamer-language-cli) and [editor](https://github.com/dilanx/GamerLanguage#compiling-and-running-with-the-gamer-language-cli) (editor doesn't have to be set up though you can just use a regular text editor if you want).
