# Gamer Language
A stupid esoteric programming language where you program the same way a gamer talks lmaoo.

Imagine yourself in a Twitch chat but you're also coding and for a second you forget that they're different things.

It's also weird and difficult to program in but whatever it's kinda fun and it comes with a compiler and executor yay.

## Documentation and Examples
Check out the documentation here. Oh wait I didn't make it yet.

## Compiling and Running with the Gamer Language CLI
You'll need to install the epic Gamer Language Command Line Interface (CLI) to compile and run gamer language code. Dw it's easy.

1. Open up your terminal and `cd` to a nice folder where you want to put the gamer language compiler files.

2. Run the following command to download all the gamer files.
```
git clone https://github.com/dilanx/GamerLanguage.git
```
3. Switch into the CLI folder like this.
```
cd GamerLanguage/cli
```
4. Set everything else up with this.
```
sh update.sh
```

Now you're done! You don't have be in the CLI folder to run anything btw.

Run a Gamer Language file using `gamer pog <example.gl>`.

Oh and keep your client up to date by updating your gamer with `gamer update`.


## Editing with Syntax Coloring
Gamer Language has some syntax coloring in some text editors. It's not really necessary but you might want it.

#### BBEdit (macOS)
If you use [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for macOS, you can install the Gamer Language Codeless Language Module (CLM).

1. Download the [Gamer Language CLM](https://github.com/dilanx/GamerLanguage/blob/main/mac/gamerlanguage-bbedit.plist) file.
2. Move it into `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/`.
3. Restart BBEdit.

Now whenever you open a `.gl` file, it should syntax color for you.

#### Notepad++ (Windows)
If you use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows, you can install the Gamer Language User Defined Language (UDL).

1. Download the [Gamer Language UDL](https://github.com/dilanx/GamerLanguage/blob/main/win/gamerlanguage-notepadplusplus.xml) file.
2. Move it into `%AppData%\Notepad++\userDefineLangs`.
3. Restart Notepad++.

Now whenever you open a `.gl` file, it should syntax color for you (I think - if it doesn't you can select it manually from the language list).
