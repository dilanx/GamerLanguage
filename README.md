# Gamer Language
A stupid esoteric programming language where you program the same way a gamer talks lmaoo.

Imagine yourself in a Twitch chat while coding but they mix.

It's also weird and difficult to program in but whatever it's kinda fun and it comes with a compiler yay.

## Documentation and Examples
Check out the documentation here. Oh wait I didn't make it yet.

## Editing
Gamer Language has some syntax coloring in some text editors. It's not really necessary but you might want it.

#### BBEdit (macOS)
If you use [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for macOS, you can install the Gamer Language Codeless Language Module (CLM).

1. Download the [Gamer Language CLM](https://github.com/dilanx/GamerLanguage/blob/main/mac/gamerlanguage-bbedit.plist) file.
2. Move it into `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/`.
3. Restart BBEdit

Now whenever you open a `.gl` file, it should syntax color for you.

#### Notepad++ (Windows)
If you use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows, you can install the Gamer Language User Defined Language (UDL).

1. Download the [Gamer Language UDL](https://github.com/dilanx/GamerLanguage/blob/main/win/gamerlanguage-notepadplusplus.xml) file.
2. Move it into `%AppData%\Notepad++\userDefineLangs`.
3. Restart Notepad++.

Now whenever you open a `.gl` file, it should syntax color for you (I think - if it doesn't you can select it manually from the language list).


## Compiling
Compiler information coming soon.
